**My journey:** 3 years ago I transitioned from Tableau to PowerBI. I have been developing dashboards and BI / data solutions on top of this tech stack since. My journey takes me from

### 1. Data profiling, preparing,

Profiling - assessing / mapping how big the challenge is. You have to appreciate the scale of the mountain in order to conquer its peak. 

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Data modelling, orchestration

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true

### 3. Data visualisation

I have a love/hate relationship with visualising data in PowerBI.

### 4. Where to next?

At the moment I am enjoying being the main architect and executor for all thing BI. And I am well supported in my journey to understanding more about orchestrating in Azure.
