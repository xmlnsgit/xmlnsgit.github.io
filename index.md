## Weaponizing PowerBI

[PowerBI - Embedded, Paginated & Authenticated](/powerbiEmbedded)
How do you weaponize PowerBI? You bake it in and then you deliver it at scale. 5 years ago I embedded Tableau (with its quite powerful at the time Javascript API) inside a sharepoint site deeply integrated. How different would it be in PowerBI / Azure?

## Inbetween Tech stacks
[Enterprise tech stack vs Entreuprener tech stack](/techstack)
My career has yo-yo'd between enterprise-heavy tech stack and lightweight-agile tech stacks. I love them both equally and the cultures that come along with the environment. Here is my take on life swimming in both ponds (i.e. big fish in little pond, small fish in big pond)

## Visual CVs in the age of AI screening
[The visual CV - a primer](/pastCV)
The use of visualizations in CVs and resumes has evolved over time. Early resumes were plain, text-heavy documents focusing solely on information architecture: lists, timelines, experiences, education & achievements. The late 2000s saw the rise of infographics, driven by design, marketing and media. Photoshop, powerpoint and web technologies allowed visually appealing elements into their resumes, such as timelines, pie charts, and icons, to represent work history, skills, and achievements. This trend aligned with the broader cultural shift toward visual storytelling, as attention spans shortened and visuals became a key tool for making information digestible.

The advent of data visualization embedded more sophisticated charts and graphs to showcase quantifiable achievements, such as sales growth, project impact, or technical skills proficiency. This approach demonstrated analytical abilities while providing employers with a clearer, data-backed view of the candidate’s contributions.

[Is there a place for the visualCV?](/visualCV)
As hiring processes became increasingly automated, applicant tracking systems (ATS) gained prominence. These systems index resumes, favoring machine-readable formats over visually complex designs. The focus shifted back to content structure and keyword optimization, often sidelining elaborate visuals.

### Knowledge management - notebooks, mindmaps and journals
[My dream KB setup](/obsidian)
I've always imagined my ideal notes / knowledge base as something that works like Google Maps - it has all the layers (notes, sources, ), i can go back and see where i have been, where i'm going and how to get there, and i can also understand where the busy / high value areas are in the map.

[Digital workspaces](/macros)
I am a strong proponent of understanding human factors in designing HCI (Human-Computer Interaction). The concept of HOTAS (Hands-On Throttle and Stick) deeply influences my personal philosophy of optimizing my workspace—both physical and digital—to align with my "flow." One of my longtime mice, the Logitech M720, was only recently replaced by the G502X, maybe in part due to its gaming pedigree, but because its design evolution stabilized. Product evolution may stagnate but think about how boring (read: stable) the last few iterations of iphone has been. Every button position on the G502X would have been battle-tested, refined by countless gaming deaths and wins. Each button’s placement, size, and purpose would have been rigorously validated through real-world affordance.

The same with tooling - autohotkey, nodejs
