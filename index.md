## Inbetween Tech stacks - as a tech-tician 
[Enterprise tech stack vs Entreuprener tech stack](/techstack)

I navigate back & forth between enterprise-heavy tech stacks and lightweight-agile tech stacks in my career. There's always specific sub-cultures, ceremonies and rituals when it comes to an organisation's techstack. I guess it depends on how you swim if you're a big fish in a little pond or as a small fish in a big pond. There's always the spaces in between the lines as well.

## Visual CVs in the era of ATS / AI

My use of visualizations in CVs/resumes has definitely evolved over time. Early on they were plain, text-heavy strongly sectioned documents focusing solely on information architecture : lists, timelines, experiences, education & achievements. By the late 2000s it was infographics, driven by design, marketing and media. Photoshop/Illustrator, powerpoint and new web formats influenced the visuals that made it into the yearly cycles and things such as timelines, pie charts, and icons were used to represent work history, skills, and achievements. This trend aligned with that generational shift towards 'visual & data storytelling' and so as attention spans shortened so did the use/overuse of visuals. 

[My visual CV - a primer](/pastCV)

The rise of the ~machines~ applicant tracking systems (ATS) as they ingest and index resumes and algortihmically trawl machine-readable formats can mean that visually complex designs tend to be penalized. As the focus shifts back to content structure and keyword optimization this often have resulted in a bit of sidelining of elaborate visuals. The hybrid approach I'm currently tinkering with at the moment involves a combination of metadata, markdown and generative text via themes. Using AI to outsmart AI doesn't seem like a good idea, as I believe the better use of GenAI is in order to catch the attention of the 'human in the loop'

## Knowledge management
[Notebooks, Mindmaps & Journals](/kb)
I've always imagined my ideal notes / knowledge base as something that works like Google Maps - it has all the layers (notes, sources, ), i can go back and see where i have been, where i'm going and how to get there, and i can also understand where the busy / high value areas are in the map.

[Digital workspaces](/macros)
I am a strong proponent of understanding human factors in designing HCI (Human-Computer Interaction). The concept of HOTAS (Hands-On Throttle and Stick) deeply influences my personal philosophy of optimizing my workspace—both physical and digital—to align with my "flow." One of my longtime mice, the Logitech M720, was only recently replaced by the G502X, maybe in part due to its gaming pedigree, but because its design evolution stabilized. Product evolution may stagnate but think about how boring (read: stable) the last few iterations of iphone has been. Every button position on the G502X would have been battle-tested, refined by countless gaming deaths and wins. Each button’s placement, size, and purpose would have been rigorously validated through real-world affordance.

The same with tooling - autohotkey, nodejs
