## Licensed to engineer - DP-Six Double O

[PowerBI & Fabic](/powerbiEmbedded)

I'm on a journey back into the enterprise space having spent the last 2-3 years purely on raw visualisation, custom visuals and dashboards. Just received my "double-O" status [(DP-six double o)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/users/basilrakawi/credentials/certification/fabric-analytics-engineer-associate?tab=credentials-tab) and fully credentialled to say I do 'engineering'.

## Inbetween Tech stacks - as a tech-tician 
[Enterprise tech stack vs Entreuprener tech stack](/techstack)

<<<<<<< HEAD
Throughout my career I have oftened bounced between enterprise-heavy tech stacks and lightweight-agile stacks (fintech / startups). Balancing my Learn rate vs Burn rate (unbilled or bench), BYOD vs project sponsored/managed, lean vs monolith... it does makes for a lot of overthinking/over-engineering at times but there are ways of thinking to give you a better perspective of what the business needs, appetite and priorities are. This is my brain dump as a tactical operator operating in between tech stacks.

## Fighting the talent war as a tech-tical operator
[My visual CV - a primer](/pastCV)
My use of visualizations in CVs/resumes has evolved along with the arms race / talent war. The first few generations was always to strike the balance in IA (information architecture): Getting the right mix of visuals vs semantics - i.e. right placement of lists, timelines and edu-perience / achievements in order to be scanned optimally (by both the human as well as machine/aritifical eye). Maintaining multiple versions was never going to be a permanent solution, and so I've shifted towards a "bespoke balancing" of 'visual & data storytelling' as my current design philosophy. 

[Is there a place for the visualCV?](/visualCV)
Designing around applicant tracking systems (ATS) was always going to be black-box engineering. I'm always wary that any visually complex designs can be penalized and there is alwasy undeniable truth that content structure and keyword optimization mean that visuals have to be muted in favor of metadata extraction. The hybrid approach I'm currently tinkering with at the moment involves the combo of metadata, markdown and generative text via themes. Using AI to outsmart AI will never be a finite game and so the use of GenAI should be the best way to catch (the attention) of the 'human in the loop'.

I navigate back & forth between enterprise-heavy tech stacks and lightweight-agile tech stacks in my career. There's always specific sub-cultures, ceremonies and rituals when it comes to an organisation's techstack. I guess it depends on how you swim if you're a big fish in a little pond or as a small fish in a big pond. There's always the spaces in between the lines as well.

## Visual CVs in the era of ATS / AI

My use of visualizations in CVs/resumes has definitely evolved over time. Early on they were plain, text-heavy strongly sectioned documents focusing solely on information architecture : lists, timelines, experiences, education & achievements. By the late 2000s it was infographics, driven by design, marketing and media. Photoshop/Illustrator, powerpoint and new web formats influenced the visuals that made it into the yearly cycles and things such as timelines, pie charts, and icons were used to represent work history, skills, and achievements. This trend aligned with that generational shift towards 'visual & data storytelling' and so as attention spans shortened so did the use/overuse of visuals. 

[My visual CV - a primer](/pastCV)

The rise of the ~machines~ applicant tracking systems (ATS) as they ingest and index resumes and algortihmically trawl machine-readable formats can mean that visually complex designs tend to be penalized. As the focus shifts back to content structure and keyword optimization this often have resulted in a bit of sidelining of elaborate visuals. The hybrid approach I'm currently tinkering with at the moment involves a combination of metadata, markdown and generative text via themes. Using AI to outsmart AI doesn't seem like a good idea, as I believe the better use of GenAI is in order to catch the attention of the 'human in the loop'

## Knowledge management
[Notebooks, Mindmaps & Journals](/kb)
<<<<<<< HEAD
My imagined ideal for notes / knowledge base would probably work like Google Maps - toggle the layers (outline, tags, color etc), go back and timeline across moments of activity as well as suggesting where to go and how to get there. but also provide some sort of cognition of whats active or high value.
=======
I've always imagined my ideal notes / knowledge base as something that works like Google Maps - it has all the layers (notes, sources, ), i can go back and see where i have been, where i'm going and how to get there, and i can also understand where the busy / high value areas are in the map.

[managed workspaces](/manatwork)
I am a strong proponent of understanding human factors in designing HCI (Human-Computer Interaction). The concept of HOTAS (Hands-On Throttle and Stick) deeply influences my personal philosophy of optimizing my workspace—both physical and digital—to align with my "flow." One of my longtime mice, the Logitech M720, was only recently replaced by the G502X, maybe in part due to its gaming pedigree, but because its design evolution stabilized. Product evolution may stagnate but think about how boring (read: stable) the last few iterations of iphone has been. Every button position on the G502X would have been battle-tested, refined by countless gaming deaths and wins. Each button’s placement, size, and purpose would have been rigorously validated through real-world affordance.

The same with tooling - autohotkey, nodejs
