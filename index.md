# WIWO - What I'm Working On

## Licensed to engineer - DP-Six Double O

[PowerBI & Fabic](/powerbiEmbedded)

I'm on a journey back into the enterprise space having spent the last 2-3 years purely on raw visualisation, custom visuals and dashboards. Just received my "double-O" status [(DP-six double o)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/users/basilrakawi/credentials/certification/fabric-analytics-engineer-associate?tab=credentials-tab) and fully credentialled to say I do 'engineering'.

## Inbetween Tech stacks - as a tech-tician 
[Enterprise tech stack vs Entreuprener tech stack](/techstack)

Throughout my career I have oftened bounced between enterprise-heavy tech stacks and lightweight-agile stacks (fintech / startups). Balancing my Learn rate vs Burn rate (unbilled or bench), BYOD vs project sponsored/managed, lean vs monolith... it does makes for a lot of overthinking/over-engineering at times but there are ways of thinking to give you a better perspective of what the business needs, appetite and priorities are. This is my brain dump as a tactical operator operating in between tech stacks.

## Fighting the talent war as a tech-tical operator
[My visual CV - a primer](/pastCV)
My use of visualizations in CVs/resumes has evolved along with the arms race / talent war. The first few generations was always to strike the balance in IA (information architecture): Getting the right mix of visuals vs semantics - i.e. right placement of lists, timelines and edu-perience / achievements in order to be scanned optimally (by both the human as well as machine/aritifical eye). Maintaining multiple versions was never going to be a permanent solution, and so I've shifted towards a "bespoke balancing" of 'visual & data storytelling' as my current design philosophy. 

[Is there a place for the visualCV?](/visualCV)
Designing around applicant tracking systems (ATS) was always going to be black-box engineering. I'm always wary that any visually complex designs can be penalized and there is alwasy undeniable truth that content structure and keyword optimization mean that visuals have to be muted in favor of metadata extraction. The hybrid approach I'm currently tinkering with at the moment involves the combo of metadata, markdown and generative text via themes. Using AI to outsmart AI will never be a finite game and so the use of GenAI should be the best way to catch (the attention) of the 'human in the loop'.

## Knowledge management
[Notebooks, Mindmaps & Journals](/kb)
My imagined ideal for notes / knowledge base would probably work like Google Maps - toggle the layers (outline, tags, color etc), go back and timeline across moments of activity as well as suggesting where to go and how to get there. but also provide some sort of cognition of whats active or high value.

[managed workspaces](/manatwork)
I am a strong proponent of understanding human factors in designing HCI (Human-Computer Interaction). The concept of HOTAS (Hands-On Throttle and Stick) deeply influences my personal philosophy of optimizing my workspace—both physical and digital—to align with my "flow." One of my longtime mice, the Logitech M720, was only recently replaced by the G502X, maybe in part due to its gaming pedigree, but because its design evolution stabilized. Product evolution may stagnate but think about how boring (read: stable) the last few iterations of iphone has been. Every button position on the G502X would have been battle-tested, refined by countless gaming deaths and wins. Each button’s placement, size, and purpose would have been rigorously validated through real-world affordance.

The same with tooling - autohotkey, nodejs
