# In-between Tech stacks

I get asked a lot on whether there are blind spots when one operates in a tech stack

## Enterprise Tech Stack
- Enterprise-grade tools. Think Salesforce, Snowflake, SAP etc.
Heavy reliance on corporate standards and compliance.

### Process & Governance / Decision making
Established processes with approvals, change management, and compliance reviews. Not always clear and also lengthy decision-making / approval hierarchies.

### Deliverables: Long-term, large-scale implementations (e.g., dashboards integrated with ERP systems).
Focus on scalability, security, and regulatory compliance.

### Learning Curve - lots and lots of E-learning
- Structured onboarding with detailed documentation, SOPs, and corporate training. Less immediate exposure to risk; mistakes are caught early through governance.


## Entrepreuner Tech Stack
- Extensive use of the quick and dirty: Excel, web-based tools etc
- Lightweight tech stacks e.g. MongoDB, Ruby on Rails, or Node.js for agility. BYOD is like fire - can be a great tool or a weapon that works against you.

### Decision making
- Fast-paced, immediate decision cyclesâ€”often during impromptu whiteboard sessions. Minimal bureaucracy, focus on rapid iterations.

### ~Learning~ Trial-by-Fire
- Immediate immersion in fast-moving environments with real-world impact. Learn new tools and concepts quickly, often with minimal guidance.
